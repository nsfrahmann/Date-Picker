# Date Wizard

### This is a web application built with moment.js to easily calculate the time difference between two points and meant to satisfy a few basic requirements:

1. Dropdown month and day fields with regular year input
2. Input based result changes without page refresh
3. Current date selected by default
4. Maintain result and input data persistence on page refresh
5. Responsive across devices
6. No bootstrap or jQuery!

### This was a very fun project to work on and I learned a lot strictly working with Vanilla Javascript. Also hats off to the well-esteemed moment.js library, I loved using it! Here's the link to the live site: [Date-Wizard](https://date-wizard.netlify.app).
